# Abstract Algebra, Tessellations, and Shaders

This is a paper I wrote for my undergraduate work on procedurally rendering tessellations in GLSL.
The prompt of the paper was "applications of abstract algebra in computer engineering."

This repository serves as a demo/showcase of several org-mode features.
Chiefly, [ob-glsl](https://github.com/finalpatch/ob-glsl) and [ob-sagemath](https://github.com/sagemath/ob-sagemath) are used to generate images for this work.
There are some org-mode specific features that come from [my emacs config](https://github.com/Shizcow/dotfiles), namely generic handling of latex header bits.

The paper content focuses on more efficiently rendering simple tessellations of the plane.
This paper presents a robust algorithm that's optimized for GLSL to complete this task.
